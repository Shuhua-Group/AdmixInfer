AdmixInfer v1.0.4
=================================================
Short Description:
AdmixInfer is designed to optimize the parameters of admixture model
via maximum likelihood estimation and figure out the model best fit 
the data. The optimization is under assumption of HI, GA, CGFR and 
CGFD model.

1.Compile
1.1 Library dependency
AdmixInfer depend on boost library, make sure the boost is installed
Installation of boost can be found at 
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

1.2 Compile from source code
It's very easy to compile from the source code by the following commands:

bash$ tar -zvxf AdmixInfer.tar.gz
bash$ cd AdmixInfer/src
bash$ make

After compiling, you will get the executable AdmixInfer, just
typing the command below to get help information:

bash$ ./AdmixInfer -h or bash$ ./AdmixInfer --help

2. Test with the toy data
2.1 A simple example

bash$ ./AdmixInfer --input ../example/sim1.seg

Example explanation:
AdmixInfer will read the ancestral tracks from sim1.seg, after a while,
the optimal model and corresponding generation will print to screen.
The format will explained later

The following is output of the toy data:

//CMD: ./AdmixInfer-fast -i example/sim1.seg 

Reading ancestral tracks from example/sim1.seg
Start optimizing process... 

Results Summary
----------------------------------------------------------
Parental populations: 1, 2
Admixture proportions: 0.287948, 0.712052
Optimal-model: HI, generation: 51, likelihood: 50290.4
----------------------------------------------------------

The results show that the toy data. The simulated admixed population
has two parental populations with label 1 and 2, corresponding mixture
proportions are 0.287948 and 0.712052, the optimal model is HI (Hybrid
Isolation), and the generation is 51. The simulated population is under
HI model and 30% and 70% mixture proportions, admixture started 50
generations ago.
 
User can redirect the output to a file, such as:

bash$ ./AdmixInfer --input ../example/sim1.seg > sim1_opt.log

2.2 A full arguments example

bash$ ./AdmixInfer -i ../example/sim1.seg -l 0.01 -u 0.5 -a 0.01 \
	 -b 100 -p 0.5 > sim1_fopt.log

Example explanation:
Again, AdmixInfer read ancestral tracks from file sim1.seg, discard
the tracks shorter than 0.01 Morgan and longer than 0.5 Morgan, the
significance level to compute confidence intervals is 0.01 (which will
compute 99% confidence intervals), the number of bootstrapping is 100,
and 50% tracks will sampled in each bootstrapping. Finally, the outputs
will be redirected to sim1_fopt.log.

The results is:

//CMD: Debug/AdmixInfer-fast -i example/sim1.seg -l 0.01 -u 0.5 -a 0.01 \
	-b 100 -p 0.5 

Reading ancestral tracks from example/sim1.seg
Start optimizing process... 
Start bootstrapping process... 
Bootstrap-1--> model: HI, generation: 51, likelihood: 19003.7
Bootstrap-2--> model: HI, generation: 51, likelihood: 18915.4
......
Bootstrap-100--> model: HI, generation: 51, likelihood: 18999.4
Finish bootstrapping, processing results...

Results Summary
----------------------------------------------------------
Parental populations: 1, 2
Admixture proportions: 0.287948, 0.712052
Optimal-model: HI(100%)
Generation: 51.08, 99% confidence interval: (50.92, 51.24)
----------------------------------------------------------

Again, the optimal model we inferred is HI and generation estimated
 is 51.08 the 99% confidence intervals are (50.92, 51.24).

3. File format
3.1 Input file format
AdmixInfer is easy to use, only need one file, in which each line 
represents a ancestral track with the start point, end points, from 
which ancestry the track originates. The start and end points units 
are in Morgan.
 
For example:

0.00000000      0.34602058      Yoruba
0.34602058      0.34614778      French
......
0.40759031      0.41517938      Yoruba

4. Arguments
-i/--input	<string>
	This argument is required, in which user specify the filename of 
input ancestral tracks, format described above.

-l/--lower	[double]
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the lower bound
to discard short tracks. The default is 0, which does not discard any
short tracks. However, due to method limitation in local ancestry 
inference, very short tracks are generally not reliable.

-u/--upper	[double]	
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the upper bound 
to discard long tracks. The default is infinity, which does not discard 
any long tracks.

-a/--alpha	[double]	
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the significance
level to compute confidence intervals, this argument is used with 
bootstrap. When the number of bootstrap is 1, AdmixInfer does not 
compute confidence intervals. The default is 0.05, which will compute
the 95% confidence intervals.

-b/--bootstrap	[integer]	
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the number of 
bootstrapping repeats.  The default is 1, which does not perform 
bootstrapping.

-p/--proportion	[double]	
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the proportion 
of tracks in bootstrapping sampled. The default 1.0, which samples 
equal size of tracks in each bootstrapping repeat.

5. Options:
-h/--help	
	Print help messages of all arguments and options

-q/--quiet	
	Running in quiet mode, default is off.
